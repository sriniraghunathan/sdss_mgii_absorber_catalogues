# SDSS MgII absorber catalogues
MgII absorber catalogues produced using quasar spectra from the SDSS survey.

# Catalogue paper: 
Please look into [arXiv:1608.05112](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05112) for details about the algorithm and the catalogues.

# Various SDSS data releases (DR):
The paper linked above describes the procedure to derive MgII catalogue from SDSS DR12 quasars. But I have also run the software on different SDSS data releases and all catalogues are publicly available.
